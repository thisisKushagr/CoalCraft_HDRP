## What is Coalcraft
- A journey of transforming traditional training of coal miners by leveraging the VR-based simulation based technology.
- The proposed framework for COALCRAFT leverages several powerful tools and technologies to create a virtual reality training simulator that is both effective and immersive. The Simulation Engine is deployed using Unity3D on a local machine, which enhances the rendering capabilities and provides a high-quality virtual reality environment for users to train in. This modular architecture allows for flexibility and scalability, making it possible to improve and update the system as needed.
